3626,pub.1129627547,10.1371/journal.pone.0236166,32706798,PMC7380625,Relationships among commercial practices and author conflicts of interest in biomedical publishing,"Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial relationships on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that certain commercial relationships may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing practices and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of evaluated commercial publishing relationships. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5% (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial relationships were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing practices and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making.","Funding is provided by National Endowment for the Humanities grant HAA-261070.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This R Shiny application aggregates data from ClinicialTrials.gov resulting from user's queries by terms. Returned data are visualized through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: The Clinical Trials Sponsorship Network Dashboard (CTSND) uses force-directed network mapping algorithms to visualize clinical trials sponsorship data. Interpretation of network visualization is further supported with data on sponsor classes, sponsorship timelines, evaluated products, and target conditions. The source code for the CTSND is available at https://github.com/sscottgraham/ConflictMetrics. DISCUSSION: Monopolistic practices have been identified as a likely contributor to high drug prices in the United States. CTSND data and visualizations support the analysis of clinical trials sponsorship networks and may aid in identifying current and emerging monopolistic practices.

In this study, we tried to pinpoint how different kinds of simulation (perceptual and motor simulation, mentalising) affect reading behaviour. Eye-tracking (gaze durations, regression probability) and questionnaire data were collected from 102 participants, who read three literary short stories. In a pre-test, 90 additional participants indicated which parts of the stories were high in one of the three kinds of simulation-eliciting content. The results show that motor simulation reduces gaze duration (faster reading), whereas perceptual simulation and mentalising increase gaze duration (slower reading). Individual differences in the effect of simulation on gaze duration were found, which were related to individual differences in aspects of story world absorption and story appreciation. These findings suggest fundamental differences between different kinds of simulation and confirm the role of simulation in absorption and appreciation.","The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript, and Alessandro Lopopolo for the calculation of the surprisal values used in our analyses.

Reference mining brings forward specific challenges, such as the need to capture the morphology of highly abbreviated words and the dependence among the elements of a reference, both following codified reference styles. This task is particularly difficult, and little explored, with respect to the literature in the arts and humanities, where references are mostly given in footnotes. We apply a deep learning architecture for reference mining from the full text of scholarly publications. We explore and discuss three architectural components: word and character-level word embeddings, different prediction layers (Softmax and Conditional Random Fields) and multi-task over single-task learning. Our best model uses both pre-trained word embeddings and characters embeddings, and a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. We test our solution on a dataset of annotated references from the historiography on Venice and, using a linear-chain CRF classifier as a baseline, we show that this deep learning architecture improves by a considerable margin. Furthermore, multi-task learning performs almost on par with a single-task approach.

The resultant groupings were in accord with traditional classifications. The use of sWords also allows a more fine-grained heuristic exploration of difficult questions of text reuse. A comparison of relative frequencies of sWords in the directly transmitted Polybius book 1 and the excerpted books 9–10 indicate that the measurements of the two texts are generally very close, but when frequencies do vary, the differences are surprisingly large.

In this paper, we analyze the language in a Telegram channel populated by followers of former US President Donald Trump. We seek to identify the ways in which harmful language is used to create a specific narrative in a group of mostly like-minded discussants. Our research has several aims. First, we create an extended taxonomy of potentially harmful language that includes not only hate speech and direct insults (which have been the focus of existing computational methods), but also other forms of harmful speech discussed in the literature. We manually apply this taxonomy to a large portion of the corpus, including the time period leading up to and the aftermath of the January 2021 US Capitol riot. Our data gives empirical evidence for harmful speech, such as in/out-group divisive language and the use of codes within certain communities, that have not often been investigated before. Second, we compare our manual annotations of harmful speech to several automatic methods for classifying hate speech and offensive language, namely list-based and machine-learning-based approaches. We find that the Telegram data sets still pose particular challenges for these automatic methods.

745,pub.1121627715,10.1093/llc/fqz070,,,Author identification of short texts using dependency treebanks without vocabulary,"Abstract How to classify short texts effectively remains an important question in computational stylometry. This study presents the results of an experiment involving authorship attribution of ancient Greek texts. These texts were chosen to explore the effectiveness of digital methods as a supplement to the author’s work on text classification based on traditional stylometry. Here it is crucial to avoid confounding effects of shared topic, etc. Therefore, this study attempts to identify authorship using only morpho-syntactic data without regard to specific vocabulary items. The data are taken from the dependency annotations published in the Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank. The independent variables for classification are combinations generated from the dependency label and the morphology of each word in the corpus and its dependency parent. To avoid the effects of the combinatorial explosion, only the most frequent combinations are retained as input features. The authorship classification (with thirteen classes) is done with standard algorithms—logistic regression and support vector classification. During classification, the corpus is partitioned into increasingly smaller ‘texts’. To explore and control for the possible confounding effects of, e.g. different genre and annotator, three corpora were tested: a mixed corpus of several genres of both prose and verse, a corpus of prose including oratory, history, and essay, and a corpus restricted to narrative history. Results are surprisingly good as compared to those previously published. Accuracy for fifty-word inputs is 84.2–89.6%.

Yet most leadership theories neither account for follower responses nor explain how followers' expectations about gender and race status-hierarchies influence their actions. Drawing on participant observation, an archive of movement documents, and 73 in-depth interviews with key informants in the occupy movement, I reveal how followers enacted forms of “discriminatory resistance” that impeded women and genderqueer persons' leadership. I argue that followers fell back on gender and racial stereotypes about white men as ideal leaders. Followers opposed women and genderqueer persons from all races and ethnicities using harassment and male dominance, and by creating a hostile culture. Findings suggest that even leaders and followers in nonhierarchical social movements construct gender and race differences in leadership similar to leadership stratification in more hierarchical organizations.",,Mobilization An International Quarterly,,Mobilization Journal,,2019,,2019-06-01,24,2,157-176,Closed,Article,"Hurwitz, Heather McKee","Hurwitz, Heather McKee ()",,"Hurwitz, Heather McKee ()",,,,,,,,,,,3,1,,2.82,12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117170797,16 Studies in Human Society; 1699 Other Studies In Human Society,Clinical Research,,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,

In this paper we describe how the project emerged from a desire to support community members. The diaries have been disseminated through public events, a website, an oral history project, and engagement with policymakers. The data collection method encouraged the participation of people with disabilities, racialized individuals, immigrants, and low-proficiency English/Scots speakers, all of whom are more likely to be negatively affected by COVID-19. This is of interest to sociolinguists, given that these groups have been under-represented in previous studies of linguistic variation in Edinburgh. We detail our programme of partnering with local charities to help ensure that digitally disadvantaged groups and their caregivers are represented. Accompanying survey and demographic data means that this self-recorded speech can be used to complement existing Edinburgh speech corpora. Additional sociolinguistic goals include a narrative analysis and a stylistic analysis, to characterize how different people engage creatively with the act of creating a COVID-19 diary, especially as compared to vlogs and other video diaries.","This work would not have been possible without the generous contributions from the diary contributors.

723,pub.1136664155,10.1093/llc/fqab032,,,A data-driven approach to studying changing vocabularies in historical newspaper collections,"Abstract Nation and nationhood are among the most frequently studied concepts in the field of intellectual history. At the same time, the word ‘nation’ and its historical usage are very vague. The aim in this article was to develop a data-driven method using dependency parsing and neural word embeddings to clarify some of the vagueness in the evolution of this concept. To this end, we propose the following two-step method. First, using linguistic processing, we create a large set of words pertaining to the topic of nation. Second, we train diachronic word embeddings and use them to quantify the strength of the semantic similarity between these words and thereby create meaningful clusters, which are then aligned diachronically. To illustrate the robustness of the study across languages, time spans, as well as large datasets, we apply it to the entirety of five historical newspaper archives in Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English. To our knowledge, thus far there have been no large-scale comparative studies of this kind that purport to grasp long-term developments in as many as four different languages in a data-driven way. A particular strength of the method we describe in this article is that, by design, it is not limited to the study of nationhood, but rather expands beyond it to other research questions and is reusable in different contexts.",,Digital Scholarship in the Humanities,,Oxford University Press (OUP),,2021,2021-11-05,2021-11-05,36,Supplement_2,ii109-ii126,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hengchen, Simon; Ros, Ruben; Marjanen, Jani; Tolonen, Mikko","Hengchen, Simon (Språkbanken Text, University of Gothenburg, Sweden and iguanodon.ai, Belgium); Ros, Ruben (Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg); Marjanen, Jani (); Tolonen, Mikko (Helsinki Computational History Group, University of Helsinki, Finland)",,"Hengchen, Simon (University of Gothenburg); Ros, Ruben (University of Luxembourg); Marjanen, Jani (); Tolonen, Mikko (University of Helsinki)",University of Gothenburg; University of Helsinki; University of Luxembourg,grid.8761.8; grid.7737.4; grid.16008.3f,Gothenburg; Helsinki; Luxembourg,; ; ,Sweden; Finland; Luxembourg,European Commission; Swedish Research Council,cOAlition S; EC & ERC - European Union,Belgium; Sweden,grant.7612965,770299,0,0,,,9,https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article-pdf/36/Supplement_2/ii109/41091152/fqab032.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136664155,"2004 Linguistics; 20 Language, Communication and Culture",,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

This process is often hindered by the high degree of variation in toponyms. Candidate selection is the task of identifying the potential entities that can be referred to by a previously recognized toponym. While it has traditionally received little attention, candidate selection has a significant impact on downstream tasks (i.e. entity resolution), especially in noisy or non-standard text. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method for candidate selection through toponym matching, using state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We perform an intrinsic toponym matching evaluation based on several datasets, which cover various challenging scenarios (cross-lingual and regional variations, as well as OCR errors) and assess its performance in the context of geographical candidate selection in English and Spanish.",,,Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),,2020,2020-11-03,2020-11-03,,,385-388,All OA; Green,Proceeding,"Ardanuy, Mariona Coll; Hosseini, Kasra; McDonough, Katherine; Krause, Amrey; van Strien, Daniel; Nanni, Federico","Ardanuy, Mariona Coll (The Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom); Hosseini, Kasra (The Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom); McDonough, Katherine (The Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom); Krause, Amrey (Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, Edinburgh, United Kingdom); van Strien, Daniel (The British Library London, United Kingdom); Nanni, Federico (The Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom)",,"Ardanuy, Mariona Coll (The Alan Turing Institute); Hosseini, Kasra (The Alan Turing Institute); McDonough, Katherine (The Alan Turing Institute); Krause, Amrey (); van Strien, Daniel (); Nanni, Federico (The Alan Turing Institute)",The Alan Turing Institute,grid.499548.d,London,,United Kingdom,,,,,,2,2,,1.45,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08114,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132891355,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing,Clinical Research; Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,
722,pub.1131831601,10.3390/informatics7040044,,,A Corpus Approach to Roman Law Based on Justinian’s Digest,"Traditional philological methods in Roman legal scholarship such as close reading and strict juristic reasoning have analysed law in extraordinary detail. Such methods, however, have paid less attention to the empirical characteristics of legal texts and occasionally projected an abstract framework onto the sources. The paper presents a series of computer-assisted methods to open new frontiers of inquiry. Using a Python coding environment, we have built a relational database of the Latin text of the Digest, a historical sourcebook of Roman law compiled under the order of Emperor Justinian in 533 CE. Subsequently, we investigated the structure of Roman law by automatically clustering the sections of the Digest according to their linguistic profile. Finally, we explored the characteristics of Roman legal language according to the principles and methods of computational distributional semantics. Our research has discovered an empirical structure of Roman law which arises from the sources themselves and complements the dominant scholarly assumption that Roman law rests on abstract structures. By building and comparing Latin word embeddings models, we were also able to detect a semantic split in words with general and legal sense. These investigations point to a practical focus in Roman law which is consistent with the view that ancient law schools were more interested in training lawyers for practice rather than in philosophical neatness.",,Informatics,,MDPI,,2020,2020-10-15,,7,4,44,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ribary, Marton; McGillivray, Barbara","Ribary, Marton (School of Law, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK); McGillivray, Barbara (Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages and Linguistics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 9DA, UK;, bm517@cam.ac.uk; The Alan Turing Institute, London NW1 2DB, UK)","Ribary, Marton (University of Surrey)","Ribary, Marton (University of Surrey); McGillivray, Barbara (University of Cambridge; The Alan Turing Institute)",The Alan Turing Institute; University of Surrey; University of Cambridge,grid.499548.d; grid.5475.3; grid.5335.0,London; Guildford; Cambridge,; Surrey; ,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Leverhulme Trust,cOAlition S; UKRI - UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,grant.7746871; grant.4576507,2019418; EP/N510129/1,0,0,,0.0,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9709/7/4/44/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131831601,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0807 Library and Information Studies; 0806 Information Systems,,,,,,,,C18 Law,
709,pub.1138362114,10.1002/asi.24499,,,Harmonizing and publishing heterogeneous premodern manuscript metadata as Linked Open Data,"Manuscripts are a crucial form of evidence for research into all aspects of premodern European history and culture, and there are numerous databases devoted to describing them in detail. This descriptive information, however, is typically available only in separate data silos based on incompatible data models and user interfaces. As a result, it has been difficult to study manuscripts comprehensively across these various platforms. To address this challenge, a team of manuscript scholars and computer scientists worked to create “Mapping Manuscript Migrations” (MMM), a semantic portal, and a Linked Open Data service. MMM stands as a successful proof of concept for integrating distinct manuscript datasets into a shared platform for research and discovery with the potential for future expansion. This paper will discuss the major products of the MMM project: a unified data model, a repeatable data transformation pipeline, a Linked Open Data knowledge graph, and a Semantic Web portal. It will also examine the crucial importance of an iterative process of multidisciplinary collaboration embedded throughout the project, enabling humanities researchers to shape the development of a digital platform and tools, while also enabling the same researchers to ask more sophisticated and comprehensive research questions of the aggregated data.","This work was funded by the Trans‐Atlantic Platform under its Digging into Data Challenge37 for 2017–2020.

We employed a new workflow, combining manual and automated steps, to predict the most likely phonetic realisations of the missing forms in our data, by making systematic use of the information on sound correspondences in words that were potentially cognate with the missing forms. This procedure yielded a list of hypothetical reflexes of previously identified cognate sets, which we first preregistered as an experiment on the prediction of unattested word forms and then compared with actual word forms elicited during secondary fieldwork. In this study we first describe the workflow which we used to predict hypothetical reflexes and the process of elicitation of actual word forms during fieldwork. We then present the results of our reflex prediction experiment. Based on this experiment, we identify four general benefits of reflex prediction in historical language comparison. These comprise (1) an increased transparency of linguistic research, (2) an increased efficiency of field and source work, (3) an educational aspect which offers teachers and learners a wide plethora of linguistic phenomena, including the regularity of sound change, and (4) the possibility of kindling speakers’ interest in their own linguistic heritage.",,Diachronica,,John Benjamins Publishing Company,,2021,2021-04-23,2022-02-07,39,1,1-38,All OA; Green,Article,"Bodt, Timotheus A.; List, Johann-Mattis","Bodt, Timotheus A.
