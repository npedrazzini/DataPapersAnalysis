By giving illustrative examples and many practical tips, they let the reader participate in their vast experience in this quickly evolving field of research.”--Gregor Wiedemann, University of Hamburg, Germany This book presents established and state-of-the-art methods in Language Technology (including text mining, corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing), and demonstrates how they can be applied by humanities scholars working with textual data. The landscape of humanities research has recently changed thanks to the proliferation of big data and large textual collections such as Google Books, Early English Books Online, and Project Gutenberg. These resources have yet to be fully explored by new generations of scholars, and the authors argue that Language Technology has a key role to play in the exploration of large-scale textual data. The authors use a series of illustrative examples from various humanistic disciplines (mainly but not exclusively from History, Classics, and Literary Studies) to demonstrate basic and more complex use-case scenarios. This book will be useful to graduate students and researchers in humanistic disciplines working with textual data, including History, Modern Languages, Literary studies, Classics, and Linguistics. This is also a very useful book for anyone teaching or learning Digital Humanities and interested in the basic concepts from computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and natural language processing.

This significant ‘birthday’ offers a moment to reflect on its contribution to sociological research, and on its current and future potential for fundamental and cutting-edge sociological analysis. While the study shares many features with other longer-standing household panel studies, including its direct predecessor the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), it incorporated from the outset distinctive features that make it particularly valuable for analysis in specific fields, including biosocial research, ethnicity and migration studies, and analyses of the interplay between environmental, social and institutional contexts and individual characteristics. Understanding Society has incorporated methodological development and innovation since its inception, which has facilitated more extensive forms of data collection.","Understanding Society is primarily funded by the UKRI Economic and Social Research Council.

In this article, we review the online database Cinema Context (www.cinemacontext.nl) and its impact on the study of historical film cultures. Cinema Context is a relational database and research instrument for studying the history of film culture in the Netherlands.

724,pub.1128562033,10.1017/ssh.2020.13,,,Drafting the Dutch: Selection Biases in Dutch Conscript Records in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century,"ABSTRACT Conscription records are considered to be the best sources for studying heights over cohorts. This article discusses the various steps and selection mechanisms involved in the conscription system of the Netherlands, which was more or less similar to the systems found in other European countries. Starting with a birth cohort of 4,436 boys, we run a series of regressions on the likelihood to be registered at all and to have one’s height recorded. We discuss the effects of cohort attrition through mortality and migration, and explore familial, social, and religious reasons for evading registration and (medical) examination. We find various kinds of selections, but their effects on the distribution and averages of heights are limited. Thus, heights culled from conscripts records are indeed an excellent indicator of a cohort’s biological standard of living. However, researchers focusing on social variation in height need to be aware of the unequal opportunities to evade registration and measurement.","Funding received from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Giants of the modern world project, 360-53-190.",Social Science History,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,2020,2020-06-17,2020,44,3,501-524,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Quanjer, Björn; Kok, Jan","Quanjer, Björn (Radboud University); Kok, Jan (Radboud University)","Quanjer, Björn (Radboud University Nijmegen)","Quanjer, Björn (Radboud University Nijmegen); Kok, Jan (Radboud University Nijmegen)",Radboud University Nijmegen,grid.5590.9,Nijmegen,Gelderland,Netherlands,Dutch Research Council,cOAlition S,Netherlands,grant.5302552,360-53-190,7,6,,20.76,1,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D34F93C8537CFC5141E0C6778E1A9921/S0145553220000139a.pdf/div-class-title-drafting-the-dutch-selection-biases-in-dutch-conscript-records-in-the-second-half-of-the-nineteenth-century-div.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128562033,22 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 2202 History and Philosophy of Specific Fields,,Generic health relevance,,,,,,D25 Area Studies,

Cinema-going at the zoological garden in occupied Antwerp, 1915–1918","A Captivated Audience studies the organization, regulation and consumption of culture in occupied Belgium during the First World War. Through a case-study of the founding and day-to-day operations of Cinema Zoologie, the film theatre located at the Antwerp Zoo, it is demonstrated how tensions between organizers, audiences and the occupying force are played out in the leisure sphere. The film theatre is presented as an arena of conflicting interests where politics, business and patriotism clash. Cinema Zoologie was operated by the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (owner of the Antwerp Zoo), a bourgeois society with an international membership and ties with the German community in Antwerp. As a movie theatre located in this thoroughly bourgeois environment, Cinema Zoologie is also an ideal microcosm to study wartime reactions to filmed entertainment and information as well as bourgeois cinema-going experiences. The research presented here is largely based on primary sources from the extensive archives of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp kept at the Antwerp City Archive (Felixarchief).","No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors. The authors would like to thank the Antwerp City Archive (Ms. Giovanna Visini and Ms. Inge Schoups) as well as the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (Mr. Dries Herpoelaert, Mr. Gie Robeyns and Ms. Ann Mariën) for their support and for making the archives available.

The results show that horror trailers have a three-part structure that involves establishing the narrative, emotionally engaging the audience, and communicating marketing information. The soundtrack is organised in such a way that different functions are handled by different components in different segments of the soundtrack: dialogue bears responsibility for what we know and the sound for what we feel. Music is employed in a limited number of ways that are ironic, clichéd, and rarely contribute to the dominant emotional tone. Different types of sonic affective events fulfil different roles within horror trailers in relation to narrative, emotion, and marketing. I identify two features not previously discussed in relation to quantitative analysis of film soundtracks: an affective event based on the reactions of characters in horror trailers and the presence of nonlinear features in the sound design of affective events.",,Music Sound and the Moving Image,,Liverpool University Press,,2020,,,14,1,47-71,Closed,Article,"REDFERN, NICK","REDFERN, NICK ()",,"REDFERN, NICK ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,4,,11.14,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130809897,"1902 Film, Television and Digital Media; 19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing",,,,,,,,"D33 Music, Drama, Dance, Performing Arts, Film and Screen Studies",

In order to fully use this potential, harmonization of these censuses is essential. During the last decades, enormous efforts have been undertaken in digitizing the published aggregated outcomes of the Dutch historical censuses (1795–1971). Although the accessibility has been improved enormously, researchers must cope with hundreds of heterogeneous and disconnected Excel tables. As a result, the census is still for the most part an untapped source of information.

It contains the list of 23 indicators used to assess sustainability in food and agri-food value chains. This list was drawn up on the basis of a literature review and the FAO’s Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA) indicators (FAO 2013). The chapter presents the assumptions and choices, the process of data collection and the indicator estimation methods designed to assess the three sustainability dimensions within a reasonable time constraint, i.e. three person.months for each food quality scheme and its non-certified reference product. Several prioritizations were set regarding data collection (indicator, variable, value chain level) together with a level of representativeness specific to each variable and product type (country and sector). This chapter also summarizes how relatively common variables (e.g., number of animals per hectare, …) collected for each case study are combined into indicators (e.g., carbon footprint), thus providing the key for their interpretation in subsequent chapters.",,,Sustainability of European Food Quality Schemes,Springer Nature,,2019,2019-11-16,2019,,,23-45,Closed,Chapter,"Bellassen, Valentin; Antonioli, Federico; Bodini, Antonio; Donati, Michele; Drut, Marion; de Labarre, Matthieu Duboys; Hilal, Mohamed; Monier-Dilhan, Sylvette; Muller, Paul; Poméon, Thomas; Veneziani, Mario","Bellassen, Valentin (CESAER, AgroSup Dijon, INRA, Univ.
