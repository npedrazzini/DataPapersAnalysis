100,pub.1146553221,10.5334/johd.59,,,"Accessibility, Discoverability, and Functionality: An Audit of and Recommendations for Digital Language Archives","While digital archiving has long been standard for linguistics, archives themselves are heterogeneous (Aznar & Seifart 2020), and archived linguistic material is important for researchers and communities, particularly for language reclamation (cf. Baldwin & Olds 2007; Whalen et al. 2016; Hinton 2003, 2018; Kung et al. 2020). The format and usability of scholarly archival collections is shaped by the functions of the management practices at the stewarding institution, making an appreciation of the range of access services provided by such institutions relevant to the evaluation of individual collections.Here we report on a review of 41 digital language archives. Three factors are examined: 1) accessibility, including metadata and site navigation; 2) discoverability, or searchability and internal navigation; and 3) functionality, the overall ease of data retrieval and use. We recognize that the decisions made by both stewards and depositors can greatly impact the accessibility of archived materials; to that end, we present recommendations for how archives might increase the utility of their holdings for their users. We emphasize that our intention is not to dissuade linguists from using archives because of these issues, and we recognize the tremendous amount of work that goes into the upkeep of digital infrastructure, often with very limited institutional support. Implementing such recommendations at an institutional level can establish a fairer peer-review process of archival collections. By delineating precisely what standards fall under the archive management level and what procedures individual depositors are responsible for, the roles of “archivist” and “depositor” become clearer.",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2022,2022-03-24,2022-03-24,8,0,10,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yi, Irene; Lake, Amelia; Kim, Juhyae; Haakman, Kassandra; Jewell, Jeremiah; Babinski, Sarah; Bowern, Claire","Yi, Irene (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT); Lake, Amelia (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT); Kim, Juhyae (Linguistics Department, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); Haakman, Kassandra (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT); Jewell, Jeremiah (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT); Babinski, Sarah (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT); Bowern, Claire (Linguistics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT)",,"Yi, Irene (Yale University); Lake, Amelia (Yale University); Kim, Juhyae (Cornell University); Haakman, Kassandra (Yale University); Jewell, Jeremiah (Yale University); Babinski, Sarah (Yale University); Bowern, Claire (Yale University)",Yale University; Cornell University,grid.47100.32; grid.5386.8,New Haven; Ithaca,Connecticut; New York,United States; United States,,,,,,0,0,,,,http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.59/galley/123/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146553221,"2004 Linguistics; 20 Language, Communication and Culture; 2102 Curatorial and Related Studies; 21 History and Archaeology",,,,,,,,D27 English Language and Literature,

Spanning the period between the founding of Leiden University in 1575 until its temporary dissolution in 1811, these documents are well-suited for historical linguistic research of Dutch in general, and for those interested in the relationships between norm and language in particular, as the period covers a key period in the codification of Dutch (ca. 1550–1804). In this data paper, the author introduces and describes the Leiden University Resolutions Appendici Corpus ( lurac ), a single-domain (i.e., context of interaction), multi-genre diachronic corpus of 103,451 words, consisting of samples of the Appendici to the Leiden University Resolutions for ten time periods of 25 years between 1575 and 1811.

100,pub.1144628418,10.5334/johd.58,,,From Static to Interactive Maps: Drawing Diachronic Maps of (Latin) Modality with <i>Pygmalion</i>,"In this paper, we present the diachronic maps of a selection of 75 Latin modal markers designed through the tool Pygmalion. Both the maps and Pygmalion were conceived in the framework of the WoPoss project, which aims at analysing the diachronic pathways of modality in Latin. While the description of the tool and its functionalities is beyond the scope of this paper, we focus here on the description of our diachronic modal maps.Using visualisations to represent semantic shifts is a well-known practice in some linguistic fields such as typology and lexicography, and they have already been applied to modality. Though the situation is rapidly evolving, typological semantic maps as well as lexicographic maps are still for the most part static and usually not-interactive visualisations. Our modal maps stand out not only for their interactivity, but also for the richness of the information conveyed: chronology, etymology, semantics, syntax, first attestation and diachronic relationships between the meanings.After presenting our conceptual framework for modality, we illustrate the process of conceptualisation and development of our diachronic maps of modality. More specifically, we explain how we gathered and organised the data in order to transpose it into a visual representation. We then showcase the map of possum as an example of our results. Subsequently, we discuss the results with respect to previous literature concerning both visualisation of modal evolution from a general point of view and the investigation of modality in Latin.

The indicators are estimated at different levels of the value chain: farm level, processing level, and retail level. It also contains the raw data based on which the indicators are estimated, its source, and the completed spreadsheet calculators for the following indicators: carbon footprint and food miles. This article describes the common method and indicators used to collect data for the twenty-seven certified products and their conventional counterparts. It presents the assumptions and choices, the process of data collection, and the indicator estimation methods designed to assess the three sustainability dimensions within a reasonable time constraint.

They give an example of historical analyses made possible by this dataset. Moreover, they take these census data as an example of preparing and publishing a large dataset.

As the social, but also the legal status of women and men changes as soon as they enter marriage and – by extension – their preceding wedding engagement, registers are and were being kept to record this life event in most societies. The difficulty in studying the long-term development of marriage patterns is the need for, among other things, detailed information about the marriage formation process. Most of the research on marriage patterns is based on a limited amount of data. Data either cover only a limited period (at most several consecutive decades), a limited number of variables, a relatively small number of marriages, and/or a relatively small town or region. The Amsterdam marriage banns registers are an exception to the above, in terms of content, focus area, and volume. In this article, we present the dataset results of the Citizen Science project ‘Ja, ik wil!’ [‘Yes, I do!’], involving over 500 participants retrieving a wide range of socio-economic data on over 94,000 couples from the rich source of the historical Amsterdam marriage banns registers, covering every fifth year between 1580 and 1810.","The authors would like to thank all participants in the Ja, ik wil! project for their contribution to the project and the data collection for this database.

In this context, the dominant discourses have been generated in the Global North, overwhelmingly by a minority of wealthy and powerful authors, reflecting narrowly on a crisis that, while impacting the whole world, is experienced in vastly different ways. This article frames and contextualises data from this project through an introduction to the background, contexts, and methods of a project designed to reflect the lived experiences of, perspectives on, and responses to COVID-19 in vulnerable communities across sub-Saharan Africa. The project has been carried out by a large team of collaborators who prioritise the lived experiences, customs, and needs of the communities engaged through a culturally responsive and arts-based research approach.

Over the course of the pandemic, various initiatives have emerged that have tried to capture this unique moment in history by collecting documentation on the social and cultural impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives. Most of these collections were created bottom-up, either by actively approaching individuals or communities to contribute or be interviewed, or by opening platforms where citizens could directly contribute documentation. In this paper, we analyse two such citizen-generated collections of experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic: the ‘Corona in the City’ collection, assembled by the Amsterdam Museum for an online exhibition with the same title, and the ‘Dagboek Corona’ (Corona Diary) collection of diary contributions, assembled by the Dutch public historian and journalist José Boon. The paper discusses the background of these citizen-generated COVID-19 collections, assessing their scope and accessibility, and presenting a first, qualitative analysis of their content.

This paper compares different text recognition engines and their performance on a test set independent of the training and validation sets. We argue that both, test set and ground truth, should be made available by researchers as part of a shared task to allow for the comparison of engines. This will give insight into the range of possible options for institutions in need of recognition models. As a test set, we provide a data set consisting of 2,426 lines which have been randomly selected from meeting minutes of the Swiss Federal Council from 1848 to 1903. To our knowledge, neither the aforementioned text lines, which we take as ground truth, nor the multitude of different hands within this corpus have ever been used to train handwritten text recognition models. In addition, the data set used is perfect for making comparisons involving recognition engines and large training sets due to its variability and the time frame it spans. Consequently, this paper argues that both the tested engines, HTR+ and PyLaia, can handle large training sets.

100,pub.1139423824,10.5334/johd.31,,,The Telegram Chronicles of Online Harm,"Harmful language is frequent in social media, in particular in spaces which are considered anonymous and/or allow free participation. In this paper, we analyze the language in a Telegram channel populated by followers of former US President Donald Trump. We seek to identify the ways in which harmful language is used to create a specific narrative in a group of mostly like-minded discussants. Our research has several aims. First, we create an extended taxonomy of potentially harmful language that includes not only hate speech and direct insults (which have been the focus of existing computational methods), but also other forms of harmful speech discussed in the literature. We manually apply this taxonomy to a large portion of the corpus, including the time period leading up to and the aftermath of the January 2021 US Capitol riot. Our data gives empirical evidence for harmful speech, such as in/out-group divisive language and the use of codes within certain communities, that have not often been investigated before. Second, we compare our manual annotations of harmful speech to several automatic methods for classifying hate speech and offensive language, namely list-based and machine-learning-based approaches. We find that the Telegram data sets still pose particular challenges for these automatic methods. Finally, we argue for the value of studying such naturally-occurring, coherent data sets for research on online harm and how to address it in linguistics and philosophy.",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2021,,2021,7,0,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Scheffler, Tatjana; Solopova, Veronika; Popa-Wyatt, Mihaela","Scheffler, Tatjana (German Studies, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum); Solopova, Veronika (Dahlem Center for Machine Learning and Robotics, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin); Popa-Wyatt, Mihaela (Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, Berlin)",,"Scheffler, Tatjana (Ruhr University Bochum); Solopova, Veronika (Free University of Berlin); Popa-Wyatt, Mihaela (Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics)",Free University of Berlin; Ruhr University Bochum; Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics,grid.14095.39; grid.5570.7; grid.473828.2,Berlin; Bochum; Berlin,; Nordrhein-Westfalen; ,Germany; Germany; Germany,,,,,,1,1,,,28,http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.31/galley/53/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139423824,"2004 Linguistics; 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing; 20 Language, Communication and Culture; 08 Information and Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

As this data becomes more readily available, automatic tools are increasingly needed to help speed up the annotation process and improve consistency. Last year, such a toolkit was developed to semi-automatically annotate transcribed bilingual code-switched Vietnamese-English speech data with token-based language information and POS tags (hereafter the CanVEC toolkit, L. Nguyen & Bryant, 2020). In this work, we extend this methodology to another language pair, Hindi-English, to explore the extent to which we can standardise the automation process. Specifically, we applied the principles behind the CanVEC toolkit to data from the International Conference on Natural Language Processing (ICON) 2016 shared task, which consists of social media posts (Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp) that have been annotated with language and POS tags (Molina et al., 2016). We used the ICON-2016 annotations as the gold-standard labels in the language identification task. Ultimately, our tool achieved an F1 score of 87.99% on the ICON-2016 data. We then evaluated the first 500 tokens of each social media subset manually, and found almost 40% of all errors were caused entirely by problems with the gold-standard, i.e., our system was correct. It is thus likely that the overall accuracy of our system is higher than reported. This shows great potential for effectively automating the annotation of code-switched corpora, on different language combinations, and in different genres. We finally discuss some limitations of our approach and release our code and human evaluation together with this paper.",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2021,,2021,7,0,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nguyen, Li; Bryant, Christopher; Kidwai, Sana; Biberauer, Theresa","Nguyen, Li (ALTA, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge); Bryant, Christopher (ALTA, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge); Kidwai, Sana (Section of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge); Biberauer, Theresa (Section of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge)",,"Nguyen, Li (University of Cambridge); Bryant, Christopher (University of Cambridge); Kidwai, Sana (University of Cambridge); Biberauer, Theresa (University of Cambridge)",University of Cambridge,grid.5335.0,Cambridge,,United Kingdom,,,,,,0,0,,,,http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.44/galley/51/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139169690,"2004 Linguistics; 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing; 20 Language, Communication and Culture; 08 Information and Computing Sciences",,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Many common objects of humanistic inquiry, such as literary, historiographic, and biographical texts are often not easily transformed into the kinds of data structures necessary for network visualization. The Transparency to Visibility (T2V) Project was initiated to develop new methods and toolkits that can support humanistic researchers who need to extract relationship data from unstructured texts to support network visualization. The T2V team used bioethics accountability statements to pilot and evaluate different methods for extracting relationship data.

Formerly hidden in boxes with archival ephemera, the content of this collection is now unlocked by manually entering the program details into a searchable dataset. The programs give an extremely rich account of a local concert practice, the performed repertoire, and the musicians involved. However, archiving concert programs at item-level presents a challenge: due to inconsistencies in and incompleteness of work descriptions it is often hard to identify and categorize the musical works performed. For the fmcp database, the authors have developed a possible solution to this problem; a strategy for structuring and categorizing concert programming data that aims to include incomplete work descriptions and reflect genre categorizations used in local concert practice. In this paper, the authors will present this categorization method and discuss the attributes and the basic structure of the fmcp database.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2020,,,5,2,62-78,All OA; Gold,Article,"van Nieuwkerk, Mascha; Nijboer, Harm; Kisjes, Ivan","van Nieuwkerk, Mascha (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands maschavannieuwkerk@gmail.com); Nijboer, Harm (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands harm.nijboer@huygens.knaw.nl); Kisjes, Ivan (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands i.kisjes@uva.nl)",,"van Nieuwkerk, Mascha (University of Amsterdam); Nijboer, Harm (University of Amsterdam); Kisjes, Ivan (University of Amsterdam)",University of Amsterdam,grid.7177.6,Amsterdam,Noord-Holland,Netherlands,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/rdj/5/2/article-p62_62.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133252177,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0806 Information Systems,,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

Originally developed during the 1980s, the database was used as a primary research tool in the preparation of articles and a 1993 monograph: the first comprehensive study of London’s flourishing public concert life in the later eighteenth century, which culminated in Haydn’s London visits in 1791–5. The database itself, extending to over 4000 records, was derived from an exhaustive study of London newspapers. Following the obsolescence of the relational database in which the material was initially stored, it has recently been transferred to a spreadsheet in csv format, publicly available with free open access.

The database contains data on practically all productions from 1940 up to now: over one hundred thousand productions that can be freely searched using either the Webopac ( http://theatercollectie.uva.nl/search/advanced ) or the website Theaterencyclopedie ( https://theaterencyclopedie.nl ). Since 2013 the database is managed by the Department of Special Collections of the Library of the University of Amsterdam. It is the only source that offers an overview of the complete theatre programme in the Netherlands. The origins of its development lie in the card catalogue of the library of the Toneelmuseum of the 1960s. The database itself is now nearly three decades old and has grown much larger than the first compilers could ever have imagined. Until now a history of its development has been lacking. This paper offers a reconstruction of the history of the creation and development of the data and a description of the protocols and input system. This paper clarifies which sources have fed the database and which systems and productions have been fed by the database.

The data was gathered from the theatre archives of the city of Rotterdam and included data on such specifics as ticket sales, repertoire and featured performers. The database holds prosopography information on over 16,000 patrons and almost 15,000 registered ticket sales to these patrons. This dataset ( https://doi.org/10.21943/auas.7381127 ) can be used to make comparisons to the datasets of similarly sized cities in other countries during the same period and for broader research on 19th-century cultural history.

100,pub.1127812755,10.5334/johd.12,,,Computer-Assisted Language Comparison: State of the Art,"Historical language comparison opens windows onto a human past, long before the availability of written records. Since traditional language comparison within the framework of the comparative method is largely based on manual data comparison, requiring the meticulous sifting through dictionaries, word lists, and grammars, the framework is difficult to apply, especially in times where more and more data have become available in digital form. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply automate the process of historical language comparison, not only because computational solutions lag behind human judgments in historical linguistics, but also because they lack the flexibility that would allow them to integrate various types of information from various kinds of sources. A more promising approach is to integrate computational and classical approaches within a computer-assisted framework, “neither completely computer-driven nor ignorant of the assistance computers afford” [1, p. 4]. In this paper, we will illustrate what we consider the current state of the art of computer-assisted language comparison by presenting a workflow that starts with raw data and leads up to a stage where sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages have been identified and can be readily presented, inspected, and discussed. We illustrate this workflow with the help of a newly prepared dataset on Hmong-Mien languages. Our illustration is accompanied by Python code and instructions on how to use additional web-based tools we developed so that users can apply our workflow for their own purposes.",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2020,2020-05-22,,6,1,2,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wu, Mei-Shin; Schweikhard, Nathanael E.; Bodt, Timotheus A.; Hill, Nathan W.; List, Johann-Mattis","Wu, Mei-Shin (Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena); Schweikhard, Nathanael E.

These archives (or, fonds) are held by the British Library, the American Philosophical Society, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and MIT, respectively. The data were created for “The Cybernetics Thought Collective: A History of Science and Technology Portal Project” (2017–2019), a pilot project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Using computational methods and tools—machine learning, named entity recognition, and natural language processing—on digitized archival records, the data were generated to enhance archival access in three distinct but interrelated ways: as archival metadata for the digitized records, as reusable data to facilitate digital scholarly analyses, and as the basis for a series of test visualizations. The data represent entities associated with cybernetic concepts and the main actors attached to the cybernetics movement and the exchange of its ideas. The dataset is stored along with the digitized records in the University of Illinois (U of I) Library’s multi-tiered repository, a replicated preservation service based on PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies). Reuse potential for this dataset includes historical/archival, linguistic, and artistic analyses of the data to examine connections between the cybernetic entities. Funding statement: “The Cybernetics Thought Collective: A History of Science and Technology Portal Project” (NEH PW-253912-17), was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities’ Humanities Collections and Reference Resources program (US).",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2020,,2020,6,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anderson, Bethany G.","Anderson, Bethany G.

100,pub.1130788334,10.5334/johd.16,,,Introducing the Historical Index of Ethnic Fractionalization (HIEF) Dataset: Accounting for Longitudinal Changes in Ethnic Diversity,"Dramatic changes in the ethnic composition of countries in the last decades have sparked new interest among social scientists in studying and uncovering the role of ethnic diversity on social, political and economic outcomes. Yet, most ethnic fractionalization indices used by scholars to study these effects treat ethnic heterogeneity as time-invariant, thus concealing its long-term effects. However, failing to take into account historical developments in ethnic composition might seriously hinder our understanding of their effects on social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper introduces a new dataset containing an annual ethnic fractionalization index for 162 countries across all continents in the period of 1945–2013. The Historical Index of Ethnic Fractionalization (HIEF) dataset is a natural extension of previous ethnic fractionalization indices. It offers the opportunity to study the effects of ethnic fractionalization across countries and over time. The article concludes by offering some preliminary descriptive analysis of patterns of change in ethnic fractionalization over time.",,Journal of Open Humanities Data,,Ubiquity Press,,2020,,2020,6,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Drazanova, Lenka","Drazanova, Lenka (Migration Policy Centre, European University Institute)",,"Drazanova, Lenka ()",,,,,,,,,,,19,19,,26.22,12,http://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.16/galley/31/download/,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130788334,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,,,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,

However, studying crime and place is often made more difficult by restrictions on access to appropriate crime data. This means understanding of many spatio-temporal crime patterns are limited to data from a single geographic setting, and there are few attempts at replication. This article introduces the Crime Open Database ( code ), a database of 16 million offenses from 10 of the largest United States cities over 11 years and more than 60 offense types. Open crime data were obtained from each city, having been published in multiple incompatible formats. The data were processed to harmonize geographic co-ordinates, dates and times, offense categories and location types, as well as adding census and other geographic identifiers. The resulting database allows the wider study of spatio-temporal patterns of crime across multiple US cities, allowing greater understanding of variations in the relationships between crime and place across different settings, as well as facilitating replication of research.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2019,,,4,1,65-80,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ashby, M.

The text of the Hebrew Bible is a subject of ongoing study in disciplines ranging from theology to linguistics to history to computing science. In order to study the text digitally, one has to represent it in bits and bytes, together with related materials. The author has compiled a dataset, called BHSA (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Amstelodamensis)), consisting of the textual source of the Hebrew Bible according to the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS), and annotations by the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer. This dataset powers the website SHEBANQ and others, and is being used in education and research. The author has developed a Python package, Text-Fabric, to process ancient texts together with annotations. He shows how Text-Fabric can be used to process the BHSA. This includes creating new research data alongside it, and sharing it. Text-Fabric also supports versioning: as versions of the BHSA change over time, and people invest a lot in applications based on the data, measures are needed to prevent the loss of earlier results.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2018,2018-07-30,,3,1,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"Roorda, Dirk","Roorda, Dirk (Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), The Hague, Netherlands, dirk.roorda@dans.knaw.nl)",,"Roorda, Dirk (Data Archiving and Networked Services)",Data Archiving and Networked Services,grid.500519.8,The Hague,,Netherlands,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,4,https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/rdj/3/1/article-p27_27.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105955413,"2005 Literary Studies; 20 Language, Communication and Culture",,,,,,,,D31 Theology and Religious Studies,

The Dutch Historical Censuses (1795–1971) contain statistics that describe almost two centuries of History in the Netherlands. These censuses were conducted once every 10 years (with some exceptions) from 1795 to 1971. Researchers have used its wealth of demographic, occupational, and housing information to answer fundamental questions in social economic history. However, accessing these data has traditionally been a time consuming and knowledge intensive task. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of the CEDAR project, which make access to the digitized assets of the Dutch Historical Censuses easier, faster, and more reliable. This is achieved by using the data publishing paradigm of Linked Data from the Semantic Web. We use a digitized sample of 2,288 census tables to produce a linked dataset of more than 6.8 million statistical observations. The dataset is modeled using the RDF Data Cube, Open Annotation, and PROV vocabularies. The contributions of representing this dataset as Linked Data are: (1) a uniform database interface for efficient querying of census data; (2) a standardized and reproducible data harmonization workflow; and (3) an augmentation of the dataset through richer connections to related resources on the Web.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2018,2018-07-30,,3,1,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meroño-Peñuela, Albert; Ashkpour, Ashkan; Gilissen, Valentijn; Jonker, Jan; Vreugdenhil, Tom; Doorn, Peter","Meroño-Peñuela, Albert (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands, albert.merono@vu.nl); Ashkpour, Ashkan (International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam, Netherlands, ashkan.ashkpour@iisg.nl); Gilissen, Valentijn (Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), The Hague, Netherlands, valentijn.gilissen@dans.knaw.nl, jan.jonker@dans.knaw.nl, tom.vreugdenhil@dans.knaw.nl, peter.doorn@dans.knaw.nl); Jonker, Jan (Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), The Hague, Netherlands, valentijn.gilissen@dans.knaw.nl, jan.jonker@dans.knaw.nl, tom.vreugdenhil@dans.knaw.nl, peter.doorn@dans.knaw.nl); Vreugdenhil, Tom (Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), The Hague, Netherlands, valentijn.gilissen@dans.knaw.nl, jan.jonker@dans.knaw.nl, tom.vreugdenhil@dans.knaw.nl, peter.doorn@dans.knaw.nl); Doorn, Peter (Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), The Hague, Netherlands, valentijn.gilissen@dans.knaw.nl, jan.jonker@dans.knaw.nl, tom.vreugdenhil@dans.knaw.nl, peter.doorn@dans.knaw.nl)",,"Meroño-Peñuela, Albert (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Ashkpour, Ashkan (International Institute of Social History); Gilissen, Valentijn (Data Archiving and Networked Services); Jonker, Jan (Data Archiving and Networked Services); Vreugdenhil, Tom (Data Archiving and Networked Services); Doorn, Peter (Data Archiving and Networked Services)",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; International Institute of Social History; Data Archiving and Networked Services,grid.12380.38; grid.450142.6; grid.500519.8,Amsterdam; Amsterdam; The Hague,Noord-Holland; ; ,Netherlands; Netherlands; Netherlands,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/rdj/3/1/article-p13_13.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105955412,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0806 Information Systems,,,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

During the 2015 uk general election over 90 voters participated in 23 focus groups across England, Scotland, and Wales before and after polling day. These participants represented a range of political party supporters and independent voters, age groups, and economic backgrounds. They discussed a range of political issues including their vote choice in the election, their impressions of the major party leaders, why they would consider voting (or never voting) for a political party, and their expectations for the country moving forward. Special focus groups were also held around the three leaders’ debates. The 2015 qesb also brought back participants who had participated in the 2010 qesb focus groups and the 2014 Scottish referendum focus groups. The 2015 qesb has created a unique panel of participants whose political opinions can be tracked across multiple elections.

100,pub.1063364622,10.1163/24523666-01000002,,,Merchants from the Southern Netherlands (1578–1630),"In 1585 the Duke of Parma conquered Antwerp, which was followed by a blockade of the river Scheldt. A large number of merchants moved to Amsterdam. Since the beginning of the twentieth century a historical debate has been going on about the economic effects of these events. The submitted data, gathered from different historical sources, aim to provide a precise answer to this question. Information from nine different sources (e.g. poortersboeken of the city of Amsterdam, two tax registers, Notarieel Archief and VOC/WIC-archives) has been combined in an attempt to reconstruct the entire merchant community of Amsterdam between 1578 and 1630. This resulted in a data collection on more than 5,000 wholesale traders. Analysis of the data shows that migration to Amsterdam started long before the siege of Antwerp because of old commercial ties between the two cities. Moreover, the role of the newcomers was of moderate importance. In 1609 the immigrants amounted to one third of Amsterdam's merchant community. The majority of them were young men of modest means, seeking an international career in Amsterdam. Since collaboration between merchants from the north and the south dated back to the 1540s, the influx from Antwerp may be considered part of one single merchant community which developed in the Low Countries in the course of the sixteenth century.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2016,2016-05-28,,1,1,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gelderblom, Oscar","Gelderblom, Oscar (Universiteit Utrecht, A.J.Gelderblom@uu.nl)",,"Gelderblom, Oscar (Utrecht University)",Utrecht University,grid.5477.1,Utrecht,Utrecht,Netherlands,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://brill.com/downloadpdf/journals/rdj/1/1/article-p13_13.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063364622,2103 Historical Studies; 21 History and Archaeology,,,,,,,,D28 History,

Ruim 52.000 Rotterdammers en Schiedammers tussen de zeventien en veertig jaar zijn door de Duitsers afgevoerd voor de Arbeitseinsatz. De betrekkelijke onbekendheid van de huidige bevolking met de aard en omvang van deze gebeurtenis was aanleiding voor het project Reis van de Razzia. In dit project zijn 76 interviews met getuigen opgenomen, die inzichtelijk maken wat zich heeft afgespeeld, met het doel zo de handelingsruimte van het individu in een samenleving onder druk te onderzoeken. Daarbij is niet alleen aandacht besteed aan de ervaringen van degenen die werden afgevoerd, maar ook aan die van de gezinsleden en aan de onderlinge perceptie van de achtergeblevenen onder invloed van de dreiging. Als voorbeeld is het verslag van de broers Den Drijver gekozen. De combinatie van de verschillende ervaringen geeft inzicht in de dilemma’s waarvoor men in dit soort omstandigheden komt te staan.",,Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences,,Brill Academic Publishers,,2016,2016-05-23,,1,1,0-0,All OA; Gold,Article,"de Jager, Erik J.","de Jager, Erik J.

The term ‘non-professional’ refers to participants of excavations who were not part of the trained staff but who supported the dig as part of their continuous education or out of interest. Secondly, this category of documentation also includes private photographs, slides and films made at the excavation by the archaeological staff and which are not stored in official archives. Several npaph publications have previously demonstrated that this category of records is of significance to current archaeological research. The npaph has recently initiated a new project: Jericho-off-the-Record. This project aims to gather not only visual non-professional documentation of the second British campaign to Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) but also to collect written and oral records of the renowned excavation, which was conducted by Kathleen Kenyon from 1952 till 1958. This article provides an update of the situation regarding the current project of which an initial data deposit has been made accessible in easy, the dans online archiving system.","I wish to thank the following people for providing me with unpublished archaeological documentation and for their implicit support for this research: Martin Biddle, Annemie Boer, John Carswell, Dan T.
